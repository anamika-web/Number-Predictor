# Number-Predictor
A basic aspect of AI called search algorithm has been used in order to correctly predict the number. The predictor takes into account the player's responses and proceeds in its own way (according to the search algorithm ) that helps it effectively reach the player's number. It makes comparison with a random number (which according to it is the most suitable ) and following the player's response suggests another number to be compared with and this continues until the predictor has guessed the number. 
 
Since there are 1,000 possible guesses, an effective search algorithm was a basic necessity. So we have designed a suitable algorithm so that the guess is made as quick as possible. To be precise, it just takes 10 comparisons for the predictor to guess the player's number. 
 
The first page of the game will display the rules to be followed, following which will be a 'try now ' button to start the game. After being directed to the next page the player can think of any random number and answer the questions next. If they answer correctly there is no chance of a wrong prediction. 
 
We hope everyoneâ€™s going to enjoy the game. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. We look forward to the reviews of our project.
